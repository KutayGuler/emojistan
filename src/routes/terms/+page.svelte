				<h3>User Conduct</h3>
				<p>
					Emojistan is an inclusive platform. Be nice to each other, and to us
					developers! In particular:
				</p>
				<br />
				<ol>
					<li>
						Don't publish anything that
						<ul>
							<li>
								spams the service with multiple essentially similar games,
							</li>
							<li>
								infringes on intellectual property rights like trademarks,
								copyright, or patents,
							</li>
							<li>
								contains offensive, indecent, defamatory, libelous, or otherwise
								unlawful material.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Don't try to reverse engineer the software or data, redistribute or
						create derivative works of Emojistan, hack the servers, or interrupt
						the service.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you discover a bug, corrupted data, or exploit that circumvents
						the intended functionality of the service, don't use or publicize
						it. Instead, <a href="mailto:kutayguler.dev@gmail.com">report it</a>
						so we can fix it.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p />
				<p>
					We reserve the right to remove any Emojistan game, and to suspend or
					terminate any Emojistan account, at any time, for violating these
					terms, or for any other reason.
				</p>

			<div>
				<h3>Content License</h3>
				<p>
					The Emojistan app allows you to publish content you've created. By
					submitting content you give Kutay Güler a perpetual, irrevocable,
					worldwide, sublicensable, cost-free, and non-exclusive license to use,
					store, copy, modify, distribute, sell, and publish that content. You
					must only submit content for which you have the necessary rights to
					grant Kutay Güler this license.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Service Limitations</h3>
				<p>
					We do our best to provide a reliable and bug-free Emojistan
					experience. However, server problems, bugs, and other service
					interruptions may occur, and you will not be entitled to any refunds
					or compensation when this happens. In particular:
				</p>
			</div>

			<ol>
				<li>Games found in Emojistan may not work as intended.</li>
				<li>Games you have played may cease to be available.</li>
				<li>
					Changes to the app may cause previously published games to stop
					working as intended.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bugs may cause Emojistan content to disappear from your device, or
					become corrupted and unusable. (If you're building a game, make
					frequent backups by downloading the save file.)
				</li>
				<li>
					No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
					storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee the
					absolute security of information you send to us.
				</li>
				<li>
					We may remove your published games and limit, suspended, or terminate
					your account.
				</li>
				<li>We may shut down the Emojistan service at some point in time.</li>
